## We Have a Venue
We are excited to have reserved Camp Namanu in Sandy, OR for our Love Ceremony.  For folks who want to spend the night and celebrate with us for the whole weekend we will have bunks in the various bunk-houses of the camp available.
The loose structure of the weekend is that on Friday evening we will have a "Celebration of our Loved ones" through a yummy meal and Talent Show Cabaret!  The second day we will have fun daytime activities, a late afternoon Love Ceremony with reception to follow (food, dancing, and good times).
