<h2>Save the Date!</h2>
<p>
  <b>September 25-27, 2026</b> join Katie and Stewbie for a weekend of
  celebrating our love and all you wonderful people who fill our lives with joy.
  The ceremony will take place on September 26.
</p>
<h2>We Have a Venue</h2>
<p>
  We are excited to have reserved Camp Namanu in Sandy, OR for our Love
  Ceremony. For folks who want to spend the night and celebrate with us for the
  whole weekend we will have bunks in the various bunk-houses of the camp
  available. The loose structure of the weekend is that on Friday evening we
  will have a "Celebration of our Loved ones" through a yummy meal and Talent
  Show Cabaret! The second day we will have fun daytime activities, a late
  afternoon Love Ceremony with reception to follow (food, dancing, and good
  times).
